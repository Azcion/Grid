		<Label>dromedary</Label>
		<Description>A large land mammal adapted to arid environments. Domesticated since ancient times, its wool and leather are both exceptionally good at insulating against the desert heat, and its milk is quite nourishing. It can be used as a pack animal, but its bouncing gait makes it too uncomfortable to ride for any distance.\n\nBy storing water in its large humps and reclaiming moisture from its breath as it exhales, it can go weeks without drinking.</Description>

		<Label>elephant</Label>
		<Description>The largest unmodified land animal. Elephants has a long trunk they use to manipulate objects, and sharp tusks they use to gore attackers. A dead elephant's valuable tusks can be recovered by butchering it.\n\nIntelligent creatures with complex social relationships, elephants can be used as pack animals or trained to carry out the most complex of tasks. They live a long time, and are known to remember events and relationships from many decades before.</Description>

		<Label>iguana</Label>
		<Description>These large lizards normally feed on plant matter. However, when angered, their tough hide and sharp claws make them quite dangerous.\n\nResting iguanas hold their heads high, giving them an amusing 'proud' look. But they're not proud; they're just trying to see predators so they don't get eaten.</Description>
